    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you like garlic and love black pepper you'll love these skillet pork chops. Simple, yet, very tasty!</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1 1/2 inches thick) boneless center-cut pork chops</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Direction</h3>
    <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
    <p>Combine pork chops, Worcestershire, 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, and black pepper in a large, resealable plastic bag. Marinate chops in the mixture for about 30 minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
    <p>Heat remaining oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Remove pork from the marinade and place into the skillet to brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, basting with marinade during cooking,<br> until no longer pink in the centers, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p>
