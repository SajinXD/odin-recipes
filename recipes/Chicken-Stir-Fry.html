    <h1>Chicken Stir Fry</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken breasts and chicken thighs both work well for stir fries. Just make sure the pieces are relatively small and thin. Plus, they should be about the same size so the chicken cooks evenly.</p>
    <p>This easy dinner is complete with protein, veggies, and rice — so there's really no need to pair it with any side dishes. However, if you want to add something else, try one of these top-rated recipes:</p>

        "This is a quick, easy, and delicious way to use any leftover vegetables you may have in your fridge," according to Jen. "I added mushrooms and it just makes it that much better!"

        "The sauce is delicious, sweet, and just a bit spicy," raves Rita. "My family loved this dish."

        "I'm sure to make it again," says Lauretta Jean Campbell. "The only change that I made was adding asparagus instead of broccoli because it's what I had on hand. No chance to photograph because we ate it immediately."
